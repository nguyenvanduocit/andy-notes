> Configuration structs should be preferred for performance-critical APIs. While the performance can be the same with functional options, it will depend on compiler optimizations (notably inlining and escape analysis). These optimizations cannot be applied when using interfaces. Configuration structs, on the other hand, are still efficient with an interface call.
