A **single-page application** (**SPA**) is a [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) or [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current [web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design) with new data from the [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server), instead of the default method of a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website [feel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) more like a [native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_(computing)) [app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software).
